## Cloud Formation Resource Provider Package for Comprehend

Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents without the need of any special preprocessing. Amazon Comprehend processes any text files in UTF-8 format. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. With Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products, scan an entire document repository for key phrases, or determine the topics contained in a set of documents.
